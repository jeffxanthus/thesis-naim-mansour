% Installation of TOMLAB, and other toolboxes:
% ------------------------------------------------------------
%
% To install, run the installer wizard.
%
% TOMLAB will be installed in \tomlab and sub directories.
%
% NOTE: You should not install tomlab in a directory already present in
% the Matlab path, like \matlabr6p5\bin or \matlabr6p5\work.
%
% Always unzip the license file (tomlab.lic) to the installation directory.
% This file will be sent from Tomlab Optimization after receiving a
% confirmation email.
%
% --------------------------------------------------------------------
% After installation do the following:
%
%    Download the TOMLAB manual from: http://tomopt.com/tomlab/mytomlab/
%
%    cd *\tomlab (Go to the installation directory)
%
%    Install your license file (see below)
%
%    startup         % to set the proper paths
%
% If using TOMLAB permanently, after running startup, use the PATH command
% to see what paths TOMLAB created and set these permanently on your system,
% see the Matlab documentation on how to set Matlab paths.
%
% Contact tomlab@tomopt.com for license inquiries.
%
% Next, install your license file. For trial users, this is two files,
% tomlab.lic and tomlicd.dat. Put them in the tomlab directory.
%
% Permanent licenses consist of only the tomlab.lic license.

% ppderivative - The derivative of a piecewise polynomial.
%
% dpp = ppderivative(pp) returns a piecewise polynomial which is the
% derivative of pp, except at points where pp is discontinuous.
%
% dpp = ppderivative(pp,n) returns the nth derivative. A negative n
% results in the antiderivative (integral) of pp.

%
% prbfSolve solves problems of the form:
%
%    min   f(x)
%     x
%    s/t   x_L <= x <= x_U, x_L and x_U finite
%          b_L <= A x  <= b_U
%          c_L <= c(x) <= c_U
%
% Some or all x may be integer valued as specified by other input variables
%
% f(x) are assumed to be a costly function
% c(x) are assumed to be cheaply computed
%
% Any set {j} of costly constraints can be treated by adding penalty terms to 
% the objective function in the following way:
%      p(x) = f(x) + SUM_j w_j * max (0,c^j(x)-c_U^j, c_L^j-c^j(x)),
% where weighting parameters w_j > 0 have been added.
% The user then returns p(x) instead of f(x) to the CGO solver.

%             DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS:
%
%             ExD 1, All Corners. Initial points is the corner points of the
%             box given by Prob.x_L and Prob.x_U. Generates 2^d points, which
%             results in too many points when the dimension is high.
%
%             ExD 2, Lower and Upper Corner point + adjacent points.
%             Initial points are 2*d + 2 corners: the lower left corner x_L
%             and its d adjacent corners x_L+(x_U(i)-x_L(i))*e_i, i=1,...,d
%             and the upper right corner x_U and its d adjacent corners
%             x_U - (x_U(i)-x_L(i))*e_i, i=1,...,d
%
%             ExD 3. Initial points are the upper right corner x_U and its
%             d adjacent corners x_U - (x_U(i)-x_L(i))*e_i, i=1,...,d
%
%             ExD 4. Initial points are the lower left corner x_L and its
%             d adjacent corners x_L + (x_U(i)-x_L(i))*e_i, i=1,...,d
%
%             ExD 5. User given initial points, given as a matrix in CGO.X.
%             Each column is one sampled point. If d = length(Prob.x_L),
%             then size(X,1) = d, size(X,2) >= d+1. CGO.F should be defined
%             as empty, or contain a vector of corresponding f(x) values.
%             Any CGO.F value set as NaN will be computed by solver routine.
%
%             ExD 6. Use determinstic global optimization methods to find the
%             initial design. Current methods available (all DIRECT methods).

%
%             ExD 7-11. Optimal Latin Hypercube Designs (LHD) with respect to
%             different norms. The following norms and designs are available:
%
%             Percent:    1 = Maximin 1-Norm,         4 = Audze-Eglais Norm
%                         2 = Maximin 2-Norm,         5 = Minimax 2-Norm
%                         3 = Maximin Inf-Norm,
%
%             All designs taken from:  http://www.spacefillingdesigns.nl/
%
%             Constrained versions will try bigger and bigger designs up to 
%             M = max{10*d,nTrial} different designs, stopping when it has
%             found nSample feasible points.
%
%             ExD 12. Latin hypercube space-filling design. For nSample < 0,
%             k = abs(nSample) should in principle be the problem dimension.
%             The number of points sampled is:
%                   k      :  2  3  4  5  6  >6
%                   Points :  21 33 41 51 65 65
%             The call made is: X = daceInit(abs(nSample),Prob.x_L,Prob.x_U);
%
%             Set nSample = []  to get (d+1)*(d+2)/2 sampled points:
%                   d      : 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
%                   Points : 3  6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55 66
%             This is a more efficient number of points to use.
%
%             If CGO.X is nonempty, these points are verified as in ExD 5,
%             and treated as already sampled points. Then nSample additional
%             points are sampled, restricted to be close to the given points.
%
%             Constrained version of Latin hypercube only keep points that
%             fulfill the linear and nonlinear constraints. The algorithm
%             will try up to M = max{10*d,nTrial} points, stopping when it
%             has found nSample feasible points (d+1 points if nSample < 0).
%
%             ExD 13. Orthogonal Sampling, LH with subspace density demands.
%
%             ExD 14,15 and 16. Random strategies, the abs(Percent) value gives
%             the percentage size of an ellipsoid, circle or rectangle around
%             the so far sampled points that new points are not allowed in.
%             Range 1%-50%. Recommended values 10% - 20%.
%
%             If CGO.X is nonempty, these points are verified as in ExD 5,
%             and treated as already sampled points. Then nSample additional
%             points are sampled, restricted to be close to the given points.
%
% X,F,CX:     The fields X,F,CX are used to define user given points
%             ExD = 5 (Percent = 0) needs this information
%             If ExD == 6-12,14-16 these points are included into the design.
%
% X           A matrix of initial x values. One column for every x value. 
%             If ExD == 5, size(X,2) >= dim(x)+1 needed.
% F           A vector of initial f(x) values. If any element is set
%             to NaN it will be computed.
% CX          Optionally a matrix of nonlinear constraint c(x) values.
%             If nonempty, then size(CX,2) == size(X,2). If any element
%             is set as NaN, the vector c(x) = CX(:,i) will be recomputed.
%
% RandState    If >=0, rand('state',RandState) is set to initialize the
%              pseudo-random generator
%              if < 0, rand('state',sum(100*clock)) is set to give a new set
%              of random values each run
%              Default RandState = 0
%              If isnan(RandState), the random state is not initialized
%              RandState will influence if a stochastic initial experimental
%              design is applied, see input Percent and nSample.
%              RandState will also influence if using the multiMin solver, but
%              the random state seed is not reset in multiMin.
%              The state of the random generator is saved in rngState, and the
%              random generator is reinitialized with this state if WarmStart
%
% AddMP        If = 1, add the midpoint as extra point in the corner strategies
%              Default AddMP=1 if any corner strategy.
%
%
% nTrial       For CLH, the method generates M = max{10*d,nTrial} trial points,
%              and evaluate them until nSample feasible points are found.
%
%              In the random designs, nTrial is the maximum number of trial
%              points randomly generated for each new point to sample.
%
% CLHMethod    Different search strategies for finding feasible LH points.
%              First of all, the least infeasible point is added. Then the
%              linear feasible points are considered. If more points are
%              needed still, the nonlinear infeasible points are added.
%
%              1 - Take the sampled infeasible points in order.
%              2 - Take a random sample of the infeasible points.
%              3 - Use points with lowest cErr.
%
% SCALE        0-Original search space (Default if any integer values)
%              1-Transform search space to unit cube (Default if no integers).
%
% REPLACE      0-No replacement (Default for constrained problems)
%              1-Large function values are replaced by the median
%              >1 - Large values Z are replaced by new values
%              Replacement: Z:= FMAX + log10(Z-FMAX+1), where
%              FMAX = 10^REPLACE, if min(F) < 0
%              FMAX = 10^(ceil(log10(min(F)))+REPLACE), if min(F) >= 0
%              (Default REPLACE = 5 if no linear or nonlinear constraints)
%              New replacement in every iteration, because min(F) may change

% ======
% USAGE:
% ======
%
% Let the name of the problem be "RBFF Test"
% The function RBFF is best written as
%     function f = RBFF(x, Prob)
% Then any information, say u and W is easily sent to RBFF (and the constraint
% function RBFC, if present) using the Prob structure. See the example below.
%
% Assume bounds x_L and x_U are initialized, as well as the linear constraint
% matrix A, lower and upper bounds, b_L and b_U on the linear constraints,
% and lower and upper bounds c_L and c_U on the nonlinear constraints
% (Put [] if all bounds are inf or -inf). Use the TOMLAB Quick format:
%
%    Prob   = glcAssign('RBFF',x_L,x_U,'RBFF Test',A,b_L,b_U,'RBFC',c_L,c_U);
%    Prob.user.u = u; Prob.user.W=W;    % example of extra user data
%
%    % Default values are now set for PriLevOpt, and structure optParam
%    % To change a value, examples are shown on the two next lines
%    Prob.optParam.MaxFunc = 400;  % Change max number of function evaluations
%    Prob.GO.MaxFunc       = 20000;% 20000 global function values in subproblem
%
% Direct solver call:
%    Result = prbfSolve(Prob);
%    PrintResult(Result);
%
% Driver call, including printing with level 2:
%      Result = tomRun('prbfSolve',Prob,2);
%
% The user function RBFF is written as
%
%    function f = RBFF(x, Prob)
%    u = Prob.user.u; W = Prob.user.W;
%    f = "some function of x, u and W"
%
% It is also possible to use the function format
%    function f = RBFF(x)
% but then any additional parameters must be sent as global variables.
%
% The user function RBFC, computing the nonlinear constraints, is written as
%
%    function c = RBFC(x, Prob)
%    u = Prob.user.u; W = Prob.user.W;
%    c = "some vector function of x, V and W"
%
% Note! If RBFF has the 2nd input argument Prob, also RBFC must have that.
%
% To make a restart, just set the restart flag, and call prbfSolve once again:
%
%    Prob.WarmStart = 1;
%    Result = tomRun('prbfSolve',Prob,2);
%
% Another option for warm start is to put the restart information from the
% Result structure to the Prob structure and then call a CGO solver again:
%    Prob = WarmDefGLOBAL('prbfSolve',Prob,Result)
%    Prob.WarmStart = 1;
%    Result = tomRun('prbfSolve',Prob,2);
%
% It is also possible to run another CGO solver in the warm start:
%    Prob = WarmDefGLOBAL('prbfSolve',Prob,Result)
%    Prob.WarmStart = 1;
%    Result = tomRun('ego',Prob,2);

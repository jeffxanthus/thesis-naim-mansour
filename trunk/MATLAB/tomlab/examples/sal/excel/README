TOMLAB STAND ALONE (SAL) EXCEL EXAMPLE
*************************************

Requirements
============

To build and run this example these requirements must be met:

 * MATLAB Builder for Excel
 * IMPORTANT: TOMLAB STAND ALONE license file for TOMLAB /CPLEX.
   DEMO USERS CAN NOT RUN THIS EXAMPLE! Contact tomlab@tomopt.com for more
   information about this.

Files
=====

  copyexfiles.m    Script for copying the needed m-/mex-files into
                   this working directory.
  exmake.bat       DOS batch script for building the example.
  lpsolver.xls     Microsoft Excel workbook containing Visual Basic
                   macro script code
  README           This file.
  solvelp.m        A simple interface function to act between MATLAB
                   and Excel.

Building the example
====================

Copying files
-------------

This example is not ready for building as is. The m-file 'copyexfiles.m'
has to be executed in MATLAB in order to copy the needed files into
this directory. There are two reasons for this:

 1. To not have multiple copies of the same file in the distribution.
 2. To make it easy to update the example to new TOMLAB versions.

The tomlablic mex file will NOT be copied by this script. Put the SAL
version of tomlablic.mex* into the directory manually.

Setting paths
-------------

The following directory has to be in the system PATH environment
variable:

    <matlabroot>\bin\win32

Making the Excel Add-In DLL
---------------------------

Build the example by running 'exmake.bat'.

Running the example
-------------------

Open lpsolver.xls with Microsoft Excel. Click the SOLVE LP button to
solve the problem using TOMALB /CPLEX.

Troubleshooting
---------------

* If a message like this is displayed when running from the solver from
  Excel:

     Error using ==> license
     Not enough input arguments.
     Error in ==> tomlabVersion at 47

  your license is not a stand alone (SAL) license. A special SAL license
  is required to run stand alone versions of TOMLAB.

TOMLAB MATLAB ENGINE EXAMPLE
****************************

Requirements
============

To build and run this example these requirements must be met:

 * MATLAB 6.1 or above	
 * TOMLAB license file for a TOMLAB QP solver.

Files
=====

  exmake.bat       DOS batch script for building the example.
  exmake.sh        Unix shell script for building the example.
  README           This file.
  tomeng.c         Source code file for the example.

Building the example
====================

Setting paths
-------------

On Windows the following directory has to be in the system PATH
environment variable:

    <matlabroot>\bin\win32

On Unix the shared object path environment variable has to be
set to point to some directories in the MATLAB file tree. The
environment variable in question has different names on different
platforms. Here is a list:

   Linux          LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Mac OS X       DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
   SUN            LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If not already there, append the following paths to the variables:

   <matlabroot>/extern/lib/<arch>:<matlabroot>/bin/<arch>

where <arch> is a symbol for the platform running:

   Linux (32-bit) glnx86
   Mac OS X       mac
   SUN            sol2

See the MATLAB documentation for more information on this. It could be
necessary to configure the compiler to handle floating point
exceptions correctly.

Making the example program executable
-------------------------------------

Build the example by running 'exmake.bat' on Windows or 'exmake.sh' on
Linux. The MATLAB root directory is assumed to be in the environment
variable MATLAB ($MATLAB on Unix and %MATLAB% on Windows).

Running the example
-------------------

Run tomeng with to command line arguments: your Tomlab installation
directory as the first argument, and the name of a QP solver as the
second argument. Example:

Windows:

   > tomeng c:\tomlab cplex

Unix:

   > ./tomeng /usr/local/tomlab qpopt

The Windows example above requires a demo or full license for CPLEX,
and the Unix example requires a demo or full license for the Base
Module.

Troubleshooting
---------------

* If any of the steps fails when running the example program, make
  sure you have:

    * given the correct path to your Tomlab installation.
    * a valid license for the solver chosen and the tomlablic file
      available in the Tomlab directory.
    * chosen a valid solver name.

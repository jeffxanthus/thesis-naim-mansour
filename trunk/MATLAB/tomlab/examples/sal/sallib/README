TOMLAB STAND ALONE (SAL) SHARED LIBRARY EXAMPLE
**********************************************

Requirements
============

To build and run this example these requirements must be met:

 * MATLAB Compiler 3.0.1 or 4
   Information about the patch for MCC 3 to 3.0.1 is available at:
   http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/data/1-19TL6.html?solution=1-19TL6
 * IMPORTANT: TOMLAB STAND ALONE license file for TOMLAB /CPLEX.
   DEMO USERS CAN NOT RUN THIS EXAMPLE! Contact tomlab@tomlab.biz for more
   infomration about this.

Files
=====

  application.c    Source code for the client application using the
                   shared library.
  copyexfiles.m    Script for copying the needed m-/mex-files into
                   the working directory.
  exmake3.bat      DOS batch script for building the example with MCC 3.
  exmake3.sh       Linux sh script for building the example with MCC 3.
  exmake4.bat      DOS batch script for building the example with MCC 4.
  exmake4.sh       Linux sh script for building the example with MCC 4.
  README           This file.
  solveqp.m        A simple interface function to act between MATLAB
                   and C/C++.

Building the example
====================

Copying files
-------------

This example is not ready for building as is. The m-file 'copyexfiles.m'
has to be executed in MATLAB in order to copy the needed files into
this directory. There are two reasons for this:

 1. To not have multiple copies of the same file in the distribution.
 2. To make it easy to update the example to new TOMLAB versions.

The tomlablic file will NOT be copied by this script. Put the SAL
version of tomlablic.dll into the directory manually.

Setting paths
-------------

On Windows, the following directory has to be in the system PATH
environment variable:

    <matlabroot>\bin\win32

On Linux, add the following directory to the dynamic library path if
an 'undefined reference to' error is encountered when compiling:

    <matlabroot>/sys/os/glnx86

Making the library and application
----------------------------------

On Windows:

Build the example by running 'exmakeX.bat', where X is the version
number of the MCC compiler; 3 or 4. Two files are created:
'cplexqp.dll' and 'application.exe'.

On Linux:

Build the example by running 'exmakeX.sh', where X is the version
number of your MCC compiler; 3 or 4. Two files are created:
'cplexqp.so' and 'application'.

Troubleshooting
---------------

* When compiling using MCC 3 several warning messages will be
  printed, for example:

     Warning: File: cplextl Line: 437 Column: 1
     References to "lp_f" will produce a run-time error because it is an
     undefined function or variable.

  This will not be a problem for this example. All the warnings
  are about code lines never executed.

* If a message like this is displayed when running the application:

     Error using ==> license
     Not enough input arguments.
     Error in ==> tomlabVersion at 47

  your license is not a stand alone (SAL) license. A special SAL license
  is required to run stand alone versions of TOMLAB.

* If 'undefined reference to' errors are displayed while compiling under
  Linux, see the 'Setting paths' section above.

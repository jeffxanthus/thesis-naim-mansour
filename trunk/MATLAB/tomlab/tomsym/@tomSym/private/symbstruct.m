% sybmstruct - Add aflag symbols from a tomSym object to a struct
%
% If o is a cell array, then it is searched recursively for symbols.

% Only symbols that are needed for evaluation are returned. Symbols whose
% value are given implicitly by subjectTo calls, and indexes used in 
% subsVec are not returned.
